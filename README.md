# NFA-Transformation-app
Software implementation project for Theory of Computation Fall 2015. Takes formal descriptions of two NFA's and generates formal descriptions of their Union/Concatenation as well as a Kleen* transformation of the first NFA. 

How-to:
1. On your web browser, go to the following URL: http://olivar16transformer.herokuapp.com . Alternatively, you may download the source files and open index.html
2. Enter the formal descriptions of the NFA's you want to transform. If you're doing a Kleene* transformation, you may just fill in the description for L1
3. Select a transformation
4. Click "Transform"
5. R2D2 will speak and a formal description of the transformed NFA will be outputted. If your NFA's are not in the proper format, an error window will appear.
